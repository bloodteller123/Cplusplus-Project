1st mode: base mode ; 2nd mode: expert rules/display mode; 3rd mode: expert display base rule; 4th mode: base display expert mode

0.  remark: test.cpp can be used as guide to develop test cases for all classes
-1.  function tests in Deck_c is done in CD.cpp
NOTE THAT test cases for derived class are not important

1. shuffle function should be CHECKED

2. test_driver needs to be done

4. size of v_card in Board.cpp to  be determined

5. Missing CARD in BOARD.CPP is still waiting for prof response----> In the rule class, should prevent player from selecting Middle Card(i.e C3)

6. convertion operator to FaceAnimal/backgound is needed


7. container for const player& may need to be checeked

8.animal abilitty in expert mode to be done (done)
9. The expert mode game should be some derived class from game class tho
make it modular
